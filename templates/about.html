        <h1>About Breast Cancer</h1>
        <p>
            Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women worldwide. Early detection 
            significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and survival. However, traditional methods of 
            diagnosis can sometimes be time-consuming and prone to human error.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>
            To address this issue, we have developed an innovative solution using advanced bio-inspired algorithms 
            and lightweight machine learning models. Our system:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilizes enhanced imaging techniques for accurate feature extraction.</li>
            <li>Employs Genetic Algorithms for optimal feature selection, reducing noise and improving detection accuracy.</li>
            <li>Implements efficient classification models like MobileNetV2 to ensure fast and accurate predictions.</li>
            <li>Focuses on delivering a user-friendly platform for healthcare professionals to support decision-making.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            With this approach, we aim to provide a cost-effective and reliable tool to aid in the early detection 
            of breast cancer, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.
